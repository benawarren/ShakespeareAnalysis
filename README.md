# ShakespeareAnalysis

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that I have used to perform textual analysis of various Shakespeare works. I learned several methods of textual analysis in Chelsea Skalak's ENGL 222 course (Digital Humanities) at Dickinson College, where I worked on a project with two other students to explore the question of authorship in the apocryphal Shakespearean (?) poems in [*The Passionate Pilgrim*](https://blogs.dickinson.edu/digitalmethodsforthehumanities/digital-editions/whodunnit-the-passionate-pilgrim/). 

Inspired by that work, I have continued to analyze some of Shakespeare's works both as they pertain to authorship and to similarity amongst themselves.

The IPython Notebook titled "New Shakespeare Analysis" contains a thorough investigation of the question of authorship of the three *Henry VI* poems, which earlier scholarship has put in doubt. I also compare the stylistic fingerprints of corpora containing histories written by Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe.

The Notebook titled "Shakespeare Cluster Analysis" contains Python code that I wrote to support the classification of the aforementioned poems from *The Passionate Pilgrim*, performed in R. That analysis is contained in the file titled "ShakespeareAuthorshipClustering".
